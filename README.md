# Machine Learning Project â€“ Summer Semester 2025

This project was created as part of the "Machine Learning" course at HTW Saar in the Practical Computer Science study program.

## Objective

We are developing a Jupyter Notebook that automatically predicts the genre of Steam games based on their descriptions.  
As a data basis, we use a publicly available Steam Games dataset that we found on Kaggle.

## Dataset

We use the [Steam Games Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/steam-games-complete-dataset).
